COINS compiler infrastructure  version 1.4.5.2 (Mar. 2012) 

1. Documents

The documents of COINS are opened on web sites 
     http://www.coins-project.org/
     http://sourceforge.jp/projects/coins-compiler/
where, the second site has a little difference in appearance 
but the contents are the same as the first.

The English documents of COINS are in
(e-1) doc/international/COINSdoc.en/
and
      http://www.coins-project.org/international/COINSdoc.en/,
      http://coins-compiler.sourceforge.jp/international/COINSdoc.en/
and the Japanese documents are in
(j-1) doc/COINSdoc/
and
(j-2) http://www.coins-project.org/COINSdoc/,
      http://coins-compiler.sourceforge.jp/COINSdoc/

For example, to use COINS C compiler,
read "3. How to use C Compiler" in (e-1,2)
or read "5.1.1" in (j-1,2),
and to use COINS Fortran77 compiler,
read "4. How to use Fortran 77 Compiler" in (e-1,2)
or read "5.1.2" in (j-1,2).

There are also documentation files generated by javadoc command under
the directory javadoc.

The documents in the archival file are almost the same as those 
of the COINS Web pages but some items may be old or missing.
Please see one of the English Web pages
      http://www.coins-project.org/international/COINSdoc.en/,
      http://coins-compiler.sourceforge.jp/international/COINSdoc.en/
or Japanese Web pages
      http://www.coins-project.org/COINSdoc/,
      http://coins-compiler.sourceforge.jp/COINSdoc/
for the complete and most recent documents.

2.  Build/Rebuild

Expansion of archive files
  Make a root directory for COINS infrastructure (e. g. C:\Coins)
  and expand the archive file on this directory (Coins)  then
  you can get the complete source program and class files  of
  the COINS infrastructure.

Build/Rebuild with Ant

  All the files provided are precompiled. If you wish to recompile or
  modify the source code, read followings:

  (1) Preparations
    List of required software to build:
      o make
      o ant
      o javac
    Each of them must be configured properly, and should be able to work 
    only by its command name.

  (2) Building
    To build, execute one of the following two scripts at the top
    directory of the COINS:
      o build.sh    ... for Unix (and cygwin)
      o build.bat   ... for Windows
   (2-1) Unix
     Execute any of these:
       % chmod +x build.sh ; ./build.sh
     or,
       % sh build.sh
     where, `sh' must be a Bourne shell, or the like, e.g. Bash.
     The character % is the command prompt.
   (2-2) Windows
     Execute this:
       > build.bat
     where the character > is the command prompt.

  (3) Unbuilding
    To remove all directories and files created by building scripts,
    execute one of the following two scripts at the top directory of 
    the COINS.
      o unbuild.sh    ... for Unix
      o unbuild.bat   ... for Windows
   (3-1) Unix
     Execute any of these:
       % chmod +x unbuild.sh ; ./unbuild.sh
     or,
       % sh unbuild.sh
     `sh' must be a Bourne shell, or the like, e.g. Bash.
   (3-2) Windows
      Execute the following command:
        > unbuild.bat 

   (4) Note (for Japanese version only)
     The Java files on src/coins/util have almost no comments
     but you can find their original files with Japanese comments
     under the directory "alternative" placed at the top directory:
         alternative/util-UTF8 (encoded in UTF-8)
         alternative/util-EUC  (encoded in EUC)
     (Japanese comments are removed because they may cause trouble
      in building under some environment.)
Java

    The COINS system is entirely written in Java.
    Almost all modules are written by using jdk 1.4, and
    some modules are written by using jdk 1.5.
    The COINS system can be compiled by javac in jdk 1.5, 
    and can be by 1.6 with some harmless warnings.
